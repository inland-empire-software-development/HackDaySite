                    Come and join us for a fun tech event, food, drinks and networking!<br /><br />
                    Hack Days are 4-hour long events where you are given simple starter code to build off of. 
                    This month's project is a Frogger Game Clone. You will be given the building blocks to build a simple game clone. 
                    Your task is to add creative features, such as a score keeping system, speed modifiers, special items, 
                    multiple players, different game characters, etc. Polish it up.<br/><br />
