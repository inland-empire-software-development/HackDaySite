            <h3>What is a Hackday?</h3>
            <p>
                Hackday is a sprint-like event in which those involved in software
                development including coders, graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others,
                collaborate intensively on software projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Who should attend?</h3>
            <p>
                All levels of skills in every area of web development are very much welcomed to attend and participate in
                this event.
            </p>
            <h3>What do I bring?</h3>
            <p>
                This is a hands on and technological event. Bring your laptops with the code editor of your choice with any
                tools that will help you code. We will be supplying wi-fi, desks, and power outlets.
            </p>
            <h3>What do I gain from Hack Day?</h3>
            <p>
                Gain great exposure to working in teams and under pressure. Challenge your critical thinking and
                problem solving skills. Experience dealing with project management and version control.
            </p>
            <h3>How do I form or join a team?</h3>
            <p>
                We do encourage participants to start forming teams before the event. Slack your peers and find out who is
                attending and is looking for team members. Don't have one by the day of the event, no problem! Be there at
                2:45 and we will help you find a team. Teams should not be larger than 5, exclusions apply.
            </p>
            <h3>Will there be prizes?</h3>
            <p>
                There will be prizes thanks to our sponsors!
            </p>
            <h3>Who owns my project?</h3>
            <p>
                The team that works on the project is the owner of the project. We do highly encourage you to share the code
                with others in the community or making code open source but it is not required.
            </p>
            <h3>Is there a Hackday Code of Conduct?</h3>
            <p>
                You bet, see it here.
            </p>
            <h3>How much time do I have to complete?</h3>
            <p>
                The event will last 4 hours. We encourage you to keep working and improving on it after the event.
                Your imagination is the limit.
            </p>
